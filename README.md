Basic recipe website

This project gave me the opportunity to build a (very) basic website. To format the recipes, I used headings and ordered and unordered lists. I used links to connect the recipe pages to the index page and also to provide images for each recipe. And then I used git to complete my first commit ever! Shortly followed by my second commit after cleaning up my code a bit.
